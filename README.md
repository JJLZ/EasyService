# EasyService
### Presentation:
This is the practice application developed for the Android Fundamentals course for the [KeepCodingÂ® Startup Bootcamp Engineering Master IV](https://keepcoding.io/en/).

### Objective:
The objective is for the student to put into practice the knowledge acquired during the course Android Fundamentals.

### Requirements:
1. You should download the list of possible restaurant dishes from a service using http://www.mocky.io/ or from your own service, whichever you prefer.
2. Once downloaded the menu, it should be possible to access a list of tables of our restaurant.
3. When you access a table you should be able to see what the clients have requested. It is not necessary to keep what each individual customer has asked for, we will trust that the waiter will remember which dish went for each client at a table.
4. From that table view you should be able to add dishes. For this will appear another screen where you can choose the dish from a list. In that list the name of the dish appears, a small image, some icons that indicate the allergens that it has (if it has) and its price.
5. Tapping on a plate shows a screen with the information of the plate (image, some detail more ...), and a text box where to put the small variants that a customer can ask for.
6. If we save this dish will be added to the list of dishes that have been ordered at a table.
7. There should be a small menu to calculate the account.
8. Material design where possible and makes sense.
8. Different visualizations and ways of interacting for different devices as we have seen in the course (at least distinguish between Phone type and tablet type devices).
8. Support for several versions of Android, covering a minimum of 90% of the current devices.
9. Ease of use for the user.
10. Organization and clarity of the code.
